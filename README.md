# AirBnB_Clone - The Console/Command Interpreter

* Data model
* Object management via a console/command interpreter
* Conversion to a file(JSON file)

## Project Description

To create a sandboxed command line interface through which we can create, modify and delete objects in our file storage. This project currently only implements the back-end console. It is a complete web application, integrates database storage and front-end interfacing in a clone of AirBnB.

## Console :computer:

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend 
of AirBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by 
the application (achieved by calls on the `storage` object defined above).

### Using the Console

Coming soon...
